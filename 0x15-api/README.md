What Bash scripting should not be used for
Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks and managing system configurations, but it's not suitable for complex applications or tasks requiring extensive data manipulation or processing. Avoid using Bash for:

# Large-scale applications with complex logic

Tasks better suited for higher-level programming languages like Python or Java
Performance-critical applications

# What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) defines a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It specifies how software components should interact, making it easier to develop and integrate applications.

# What is a REST API

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of API that follows the principles of REST architecture. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are stateless, scalable, and widely used for building web services and web APIs.

# What are microservices

Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms like HTTP or messaging queues. Microservices enable scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment of individual components.

# What is the CSV format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and fields within each row are separated by commas (or other delimiters). CSV is commonly used for exchanging data between different software applications, especially in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

# What is the JSON format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on key-value pairs and supports nested data structures like arrays and objects. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application in REST APIs.

# Pythonic Package and module name style

Package and module names in Python should be lowercase with underscores separating words, e.g., my_package, my_module.

# Pythonic Class name style

Class names in Python should follow the CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase), where the first letter of each word is capitalized, e.g., MyClass, MyOtherClass.

# Pythonic Variable name style

Variable names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores, e.g., my_variable, my_other_variable.

# Pythonic Function name style

Function names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores, e.g., my_function, my_other_function.

# Pythonic Constant name style

Constants in Python should be uppercase, with words separated by underscores, e.g., MY_CONSTANT, MY_OTHER_CONSTANT.

# Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is a naming convention used in Python for defining class names, module names, and other identifiers where multiple words are concatenated without spaces and each word's first letter is capitalized. This convention improves readability and consistency in Python code.
