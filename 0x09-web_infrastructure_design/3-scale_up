Scaling Up the Infrastructure with Separate Components

Components:

Load Balancers (HAproxy Cluster):

Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers for load balancing and high availability.
Why: Enables horizontal scaling by distributing traffic among multiple servers and ensures redundancy for increased reliability.

Web Servers (Nginx):

Hosts and serves static content over HTTP/HTTPS.
Why: Separating web servers allows for dedicated handling of static content delivery, improving performance and scalability.

Application Servers:

Executes application logic and processes dynamic content.
Why: Isolating application servers ensures efficient processing of dynamic requests and scalability independent of web server resources.

MySQL Database Servers:

Stores and manages website data, including user information and content.
Why: Dedicated database servers handle database operations independently, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for data storage and retrieval.

Specifics Explained:

Load Balancer Cluster:

Configuring HAproxy as a cluster with multiple instances ensures high availability and load distribution, enhancing fault tolerance and scalability.

Separate Web and Application Servers:

Segregating web and application servers allows for efficient resource utilization and scaling based on specific workload demands.
