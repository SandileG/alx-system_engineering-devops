Designing a Secure, Encrypted, and Monitored Three-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

Components:

Load Balancer (Nginx):

Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
Why: Used for load balancing and SSL termination.

Web Servers (Nginx with SSL):

Hosts and serves web content over HTTPS.
Why: Ensures secure and encrypted communication between clients and servers.

Application Servers:

Executes application logic and processes dynamic content.
Why: Handles application-specific tasks and interactions with the database.

MySQL Database Servers (Primary-Replica Cluster):

Primary server for write operations, replicates data to replica servers.
Why: Provides fault tolerance and scalability for database operations.

Firewalls (Perimeter, Web Server, Database Server):

Control incoming and outgoing network traffic, enforcing security policies.
Why: Adds layers of security to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats.

SSL Certificate (for www.foobar.com):

Enables HTTPS encryption for secure communication between clients and servers.
Why: Protects sensitive data during transit and builds trust with users.

Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors for Sumo Logic):

Collect data on system performance, security events, and application metrics.
Why: Provides insights into infrastructure health, detects anomalies, and facilitates proactive troubleshooting.

Specifics Explained:

Firewalls:

Firewalls are added to enforce security policies, control traffic flow, and protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats.

HTTPS Traffic:

Traffic is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of information.

Monitoring:

Monitoring is used to track system performance, detect issues, and ensure the infrastructure operates optimally.

Data Collection by Monitoring Tool:

The monitoring tool collects data by deploying monitoring clients (e.g., Sumo Logic collectors) on each server to gather performance metrics, logs, and events.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor web server queries per second (QPS), configure the monitoring tool to collect and analyze web server logs or utilize built-in metrics provided by the web server software.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, potentially compromising data security.

Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for write operations, risking data loss or downtime in case of server failure.

Uniform Servers with Same Components:

Uniformity in server components may lead to a lack of diversity in the infrastructure, making it susceptible to widespread failures or vulnerabilities affecting all servers simultaneously.
