# HTTPS, SSL, and SSL Termination

* Understand the basics of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), its importance, and how it differs from HTTP.
What are the 2 main elements that SSL is providing?

* Explore the fundamental security features provided by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security).
HAProxy SSL Termination on Ubuntu 16.04

* Learn how to set up SSL termination using HAProxy on Ubuntu 16.04, a crucial aspect of handling secure web traffic.
SSL Termination

* Gain insights into SSL termination, its significance, and how it functions within a web server infrastructure.
Bash Function

* Brush up on creating and utilizing Bash functions, which can streamline repetitive tasks and enhance script modularity.
Man or Help:
awk

* Utilize the awk command-line utility for pattern scanning and text processing, often used in scripting and data manipulation tasks.
dig

* Explore the dig command, a powerful DNS lookup tool used to interrogate DNS servers and retrieve DNS-related information.
Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

# General:

# What is HTTPS and SSL's Two Main Roles?

Understand the concept of HTTPS and SSL, including their roles in providing secure communication over the internet. Delve into the encryption of data transmission and the establishment of secure connections between clients and servers.

# Purpose of Encrypting Traffic:

Explore the importance of encrypting network traffic, including the protection of sensitive data from eavesdropping and tampering. Understand how encryption ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information exchanged over the network.

# What SSL Termination Means:

Dive into the concept of SSL termination, which involves decrypting encrypted traffic at the edge of the network before forwarding it to backend servers. Understand the benefits of SSL termination, such as offloading server resources, enhancing performance, and enabling centralized management of SSL certificates.

**This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of HTTPS, SSL, and SSL termination, empowering you to confidently navigate secure web communication and server configuration tasks.
