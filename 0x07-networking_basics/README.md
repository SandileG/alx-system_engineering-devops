# Networking Project README

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It is organized as follows:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**
7. **Application Layer**

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- **What it is:** A LAN is a network of interconnected computers within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus.

- **Typical Usage:** LANs are commonly used for local communication, file sharing, and resource sharing among connected devices.

- **Typical Geographical Size:** Ranges from a small room to a larger campus area.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- **What it is:** A WAN spans a larger geographic area, connecting LANs over long distances using various communication technologies.

- **Typical Usage:** WANs facilitate communication between geographically dispersed offices, branches, or data centers.

- **Typical Geographical Size:** Spans cities, countries, or even continents.

## Internet

- **What it is:** The Internet is a global network of networks, connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.

## IP Address

- **What it is:** An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network.

- **Types of IP Addresses:** IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

## Localhost

- **What it is:** Localhost refers to the loopback network interface, typically assigned the IP address 127.0.0.1. It allows a device to connect to itself.

## Subnet

- **What it is:** A subnet is a logical division of an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance, security, and manageability.

## IPv6

- **Why it was created:** IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide an extended address space.

## TCP/UDP

- **Data Transfer Protocols for IP:**
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

- **Main Difference between TCP and UDP:** TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication with no guarantee of data delivery.

## Port

- **What it is:** A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system that identifies a specific process to which data can be sent.

- **Common Port Numbers:**
  - **SSH (Secure Shell):** 22
  - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** 80
  - **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** 443

## Network Connectivity Tool/Protocol

- **Commonly Used Tool/Protocol:** Ping (using ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol) is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
